crossfit_page <br>
A page for my crossfit gym. It was developed in:

- React.js (props / useState / react-router-dom / react-scroll)
- HTML
- CSS <br>

There is another page linked to the button "Agende sua aula gratis". It's a reservation form that creates a object from the inputed data (console.log)

Thank you :)
